Overview of the Fabric Tendroids system architecture.

== Architecture Layers

=== Extension Layer

The Omniverse extension provides the entry point and lifecycle management.

* Extension initialization and shutdown
* UI panel integration
* Event subscription handling

=== Controller Layer

Controllers orchestrate the main simulation components.

* `TendroidAnimationController` - Manages tendroid animations
* `CreatureController` - Handles creature behavior
* `InteractionController` - Coordinates creature-tendroid interactions

=== Physics Layer

GPU-accelerated physics using NVIDIA Warp.

* Collision detection (XZ-plane distance calculations)
* Proximity-based avoidance behaviors
* Shock feedback on contact

=== USD/Fabric Layer

Scene description and real-time data access.

* USD prims for geometry
* Fabric for high-performance attribute access
* Material bindings and visual properties

== Key Components

=== Tendroids

Cylindrical objects that detect and respond to creature proximity.

* Independent detection per tendroid
* Bend-away defensive behavior
* Cooldown mechanism for shock interactions

=== Creatures

Interactive entities that navigate the scene.

* Cylindrical collision bounds
* Proximity triggers for tendroid responses
* Player-controlled movement
