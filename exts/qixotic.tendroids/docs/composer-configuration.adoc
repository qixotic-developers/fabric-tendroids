= Composer Configuration for Tendroids Development
:toc:
:toclevels: 2

== Overview

Custom Qixotic USD Composer configured specifically for Tendroids development and testing.

== Location

* **Composer Path**: `C:\Dev\Omniverse\omni-tendroids`
* **Kit File**: `source/apps/qixotic.usd_composer.kit`
* **Setup Extension**: `source/extensions/qixotic.usd_composer_setup_extension`

== Custom Workspace Layout

=== Tendroids Layout

New custom layout created at: `layouts/tendroids.json`

**Layout Structure:**

[cols="1,2,3"]
|===
| Panel | Position | Windows

| Toolbar
| Left (narrow)
| Main ToolBar

| Viewport
| Center (large)
| Viewport (primary workspace)

| Materials
| Bottom Left
| Materials browser

| Stage + Custom
| Top Right
| • Stage (default tab) +
  • Render Settings +
  • Tendroid Controls (your UI)

| Console + Extensions
| Bottom Right
| • Console (default tab) +
  • Extensions (filtered to show qixotic.tendroids)
|===

=== Layout Shortcuts

* **Ctrl+1**: Default layout (original Composer layout)
* **Ctrl+2**: Tendroids layout (development layout)
* **Ctrl+7**: Quick Save (save current layout)
* **Ctrl+8**: Quick Load (restore saved layout)

=== Default Layout

The Tendroids layout is now the default layout when launching Composer.

== Disabled Extensions/Windows

To streamline the interface for Tendroids work, the following have been disabled:

=== Removed Tabs

* **Content** - File browser (not needed for focused development)
* **Environments** - Environment browser (disabled in settings)
* **Configurator Samples** - Sample browser (extension commented out)
* **Variant Presenter** - Variant UI (extension commented out)
* **Properties** - Property window (extension commented out)
* **Layer** - Layer management (extension commented out)

=== Why These Were Removed

* **Focus**: Reduce UI clutter for single-purpose development
* **Performance**: Fewer loaded extensions = faster startup
* **Workflow**: Tendroids development doesn't need these tools
* **Screen Space**: More room for viewport and custom controls

=== Re-enabling If Needed

To restore any disabled extension, edit `qixotic.usd_composer.kit`:

[source,toml]
----
# Comment = disabled
# "omni.kit.browser.configurator_samples" = {}

# Uncomment = enabled
"omni.kit.browser.configurator_samples" = {}
----

== Custom UI Integration

=== Tendroid Controls Window

Your Tendroid Controls UI will automatically appear as a tab in the **top right panel**:

* Same panel as Stage and Render Settings
* Accessible via Window menu
* Position preserved in layout
* Shows all Tendroid animation controls

=== Extensions Window

The Extensions window in the **bottom right panel** will show:

* qixotic.tendroids extension
* Extension enable/disable controls
* Extension manager for other tools

== Materials Browser

**Enabled** in bottom left panel for:

* Applying materials to Tendroids
* Testing transparency/glass materials
* Material library access

== Console Window

**Console** in bottom right panel for:

* Extension logs
* Error messages
* Performance monitoring output
* Python debugging

== Modified Files

=== Layout Files

* `layouts/tendroids.json` (NEW) - Custom Tendroids layout
* `layouts/default.json` (EXISTING) - Original layout preserved

=== Extension Files

* `extension.py` - Updated to:
  ** Use tendroids.json as default layout
  ** Add "Tendroids Layout" menu item (Ctrl+2)
  ** Keep original layout accessible (Ctrl+1)

=== Kit Configuration

* `qixotic.usd_composer.kit` - Updated to:
  ** Comment out unwanted extensions
  ** Enable Materials browser
  ** Disable Environments window
  ** Maintain all core functionality

== Using the Configuration

=== First Launch

. Build/launch Composer: `repo.bat build` and launch
. Tendroids layout loads automatically
. Tendroid Controls will appear in top right
. Extensions window shows qixotic.tendroids

=== Switching Layouts

. **Ctrl+2**: Load Tendroids layout (development)
. **Ctrl+1**: Load Default layout (full Composer)
. **Menu**: Layout → Tendroids Layout / Default

=== Saving Custom Arrangements

. Arrange windows as desired
. **Ctrl+7**: Quick Save
. **Ctrl+8**: Quick Load (restores your arrangement)

== Extension Directory

Make sure your Tendroids extension is in the extensions path:

[source,toml]
----
[settings.app.exts.folders]
'++' = [
    "${app}/../exts",
    "${app}/../extensions",
    "${app}/../extscache"
]
----

Your extension at `C:\Dev\Omniverse\fabric-tendroids` should be discoverable when you add it to one of these folders or create a symbolic link.

== Next Steps

. **Test the layout**: Launch Composer and verify Tendroids layout
. **Add your extension**: Ensure qixotic.tendroids loads in Extensions window
. **Customize**: Use Quick Save (Ctrl+7) to preserve your tweaks
. **Develop**: Focus on Tendroids with optimized workspace

== Troubleshooting

=== Layout Doesn't Load

* Check `layouts/tendroids.json` exists
* Verify extension.py points to correct layout file
* Try Ctrl+2 to manually load Tendroids layout

=== Missing Windows

* Check Window menu for disabled windows
* Extensions can be re-enabled in kit file
* Use Ctrl+1 for full layout if needed
