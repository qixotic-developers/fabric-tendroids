== Installation and Quick Start

=== System Requirements

==== Hardware Requirements

* NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (recommended for best performance)
* 8GB+ RAM
* 10GB+ free disk space

==== Software Requirements

* NVIDIA Omniverse USD Composer (or Create)
* Python 3.10 or higher
* NVIDIA Warp (for GPU acceleration)
* Windows 10/11, Linux, or macOS

=== Installation Steps

==== Step 1: Copy Extension Folder

----
Source: exts/qixotic.tendroids/
Destination: <omniverse-app>/exts/qixotic.tendroids/
----

==== Step 2: Enable Extension

1. Open NVIDIA Omniverse USD Composer
2. Navigate to: Window → Extensions
3. Search for "Tendroids"
4. Toggle extension to enabled state

==== Step 3: Verify Installation

* Check for "Tendroid Controls" in Window menu
* Console should display: `[TendroidsExtension] Starting up`
* Control panel window should be available

=== Quick Start Guide

==== Basic Workflow

|===
|Step |Action

|1
|Open Control Panel: Window → Tendroid Controls

|2
|Configure Parameters: Adjust diameter, length, wave settings

|3
|Spawn Creatures: Click "Spawn Tendroids" button

|4
|Start Animation: Click "Start Animation" button

|5
|Observe: Watch smooth breathing wave travel up creatures
|===

==== First-Time Experience

For your first test run:

1. Leave all default values unchanged
2. Click "Spawn Tendroids" (creates 1 Tendroid)
3. Click "Start Animation"
4. Observe smooth breathing wave traveling upward

You should see a cylindrical creature with a flared base performing organic breathing animation.

=== Common First-Run Issues

==== Extension Won't Load

**Symptoms**: Extension not visible in Extensions window

**Solutions**:

* Verify extension folder in correct location
* Check `extension.toml` file exists
* Restart Omniverse application
* Check console for Python import errors
* Verify Warp is properly installed

==== No Animation Visible

**Symptoms**: Tendroid appears but doesn't breathe

**Troubleshooting Checklist**:

1. Ensure "Start Animation" button was clicked
2. Check console for material safety warnings
3. Verify no glass material is applied
4. Confirm mesh prim is valid in USD hierarchy
5. Look for error messages in console output

**Common Causes**:

* Animation not started
* Glass material blocking animation
* Invalid USD paths
* Component initialization failed

==== Poor Performance

**Symptoms**: Low FPS, stuttering animation

**Solutions**:

* Reduce Tendroid count (start with 5-10)
* Decrease segment count (use 12-16 instead of 32)
* Check GPU utilization in Task Manager
* Close other resource-intensive extensions
* Disable ray tracing temporarily for testing
* Verify Warp GPU acceleration is active

=== Next Steps

After successful installation and first run:

1. Experiment with different parameter combinations
2. Review Architecture and Design section for system understanding
3. Explore configuration system for advanced customization
4. Read Swept Torus Geometry section for base shape details
5. Study Animation Optimization section for performance tuning
