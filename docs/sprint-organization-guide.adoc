== Sprint Structure Overview

The TEND project is organized into named sprints following gemstone alphabetical naming:

* **Sprint Agate** (Current) - Phase 1 Foundation completion
* **Sprint Beryl** - Phase 1 Contact Response & Recovery (renamed from prior planning)
* **Sprint Citrine** - Phase 2 Multi-Tendroid Selection
* **Sprint Diamond** - Phase 2 Bubble System completion

**Note:** Based on the current Jira state, we're continuing with Sprint Agate for Phase 1 completion, then moving to Beryl for any overflow, followed by Citrine and Diamond for Phase 2.
