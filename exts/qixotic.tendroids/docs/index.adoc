== Overview

This documentation covers the technical implementation details of the Tendroids project, an advanced 3D animation system featuring animated underwater tentacle-like creatures in NVIDIA Omniverse.

== Documentation Sections

=== Geometry Systems

link:swept-torus-solution.adoc[Swept Torus Solution]::
Comprehensive guide to the trumpet-bell flared base implementation using swept surface mathematics. Covers mathematical foundation, implementation details, performance characteristics, and integration with the Tendroid system.

=== Animation Systems

link:breathing-optimization.adoc[Breathing Animation Optimization]::
Analysis and optimization strategies for the traveling wave breathing animation. Details lookup table implementation, performance comparisons, and implementation roadmap for achieving 2-3× performance improvements.

== Quick Reference

=== Key Technologies

* **Platform**: NVIDIA Omniverse with USD Composer

=== Performance Targets

* **Frame rate**: 60 FPS sustained
* **Tendroid count**: 15 interactive instances
* **Animation overhead**: < 3% of frame budget
* **Memory footprint**: < 50 MB for all Tendroids

== Getting Started

For new developers:

1. Read link:swept-torus-solution.adoc[Swept Torus Solution] to understand the base geometry
2. Review link:breathing-optimization.adoc[Breathing Animation Optimization] for performance considerations
3. Examine the codebase following the module structure above
4. Test with single Tendroid before scaling to 15+

== Contributing

When adding new documentation:

* Use AsciiDoc format (.adoc files)
* Include PlantUML diagrams for architecture
* Provide code examples with explanations
* Document performance implications
* Follow existing structure and style

== Support

For questions or issues:

* Review existing documentation first
* Check code comments and docstrings
* Profile performance before optimizing
* Test changes with multiple Tendroids
