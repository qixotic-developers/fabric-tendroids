== Introduction

Welcome to the Tendroids system documentation. This project showcases GPU-accelerated underwater creatures (tendroids) with realistic physics, deformation, and particle effects running at 115 fps on NVIDIA RTX 4090.

=== Project Overview

**Tendroids** are cylindrical sea anemone-like creatures that:

* Breathe and emit bubbles with realistic physics
* Deform dynamically as bubbles rise through them
* Sway with underwater wave motion
* Feature particle spray effects when bubbles pop
* Run entirely on GPU for maximum performance

=== Performance

**Current Status**: Production-ready at **115 fps** with 15 tendroids

**Performance Target**: 85-95 fps → **Achieved 115 fps** ✅

**Next Steps**:

* Phase 2: Scaling test (30 tendroids, target 65-75 fps)
* Phase 3: Caustic lighting effects
* Phase 4: Environmental props (kelp, debris)
* Advanced: Swept torus topology for transparency
