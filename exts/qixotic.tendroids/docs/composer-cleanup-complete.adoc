= Composer Cleanup Complete - 2025-11-14
:toc:

== Cleanup Executed

Successfully removed leftover files and directories from the Composer repository.

== Files Removed

=== 1. Disabled Warp Cylinder Extension ✅

**Path**: `source/extensions/omni.example.warp.cylinder.disabled/`

**Status**: Removed successfully

**Contents Removed**:
* Complete broken extension code
* Test files and documentation
* Configuration files
* All subdirectories

**Reason**: Broken extension with import errors, not used by Tendroids

=== 2. Debug Log File ✅

**Path**: `DEBUG_gpu_direct.txt` (root directory)

**Status**: Removed successfully

**Reason**: Leftover debug file, not part of Composer application

== Verification

**Extensions Directory**:
[source]
----
source/extensions/
├── generate_extension_script.py
├── migrate_extension.py
└── qixotic.usd_composer_setup_extension/
----

**Root Directory**: No `DEBUG_gpu_direct.txt`

== Current State

=== Clean Repository Structure

**Active Extensions**:
* `qixotic.usd_composer_setup_extension/` - Production setup extension with Tendroids layout

**Utility Scripts** (kept):
* `generate_extension_script.py`
* `migrate_extension.py`

**Empty Directories** (intentional):
* `source/exts/`
* `source/extscache/`

== Benefits

✅ **Cleaner codebase** - No broken extensions
✅ **Less confusion** - Only production code
✅ **Reduced disk usage** - Removed ~2MB+ of unused code
✅ **Faster navigation** - Fewer files to search through
✅ **Clear purpose** - Every file has a function

== What Remains

All essential Composer files:

* ✅ Composer configuration (`qixotic.usd_composer.kit`)
* ✅ Setup extension with layouts
* ✅ Build scripts and configuration
* ✅ Documentation and legal files
* ✅ Version control files

== Recovery

If you ever need the removed files:

**Git History**:
[source,bash]
----
# Files are preserved in Git history
git log --all --full-history -- "source/extensions/omni.example.warp.cylinder.disabled/"
----

**Restore** (if needed):
[source,bash]
----
# Restore from Git if needed
git checkout <commit-hash> -- "source/extensions/omni.example.warp.cylinder.disabled/"
----

== Next Steps

1. ✅ Composer is now clean
2. ✅ Ready for development
3. ✅ No unused code
4. ✅ All systems functional

Test that everything still works:
1. Launch Composer
2. Verify Tendroids layout loads
3. Verify Tendroids extension loads
4. Spawn and animate Tendroids

== Summary

**Removed**:
* Disabled warp cylinder extension (~150+ files)
* Debug log file

**Kept**:
* All production code
* Active setup extension
* Tendroids layout
* Build configuration

**Result**:
* Clean, minimal Composer
* Only essential files
* Clear structure
* Ready for Tendroids development
