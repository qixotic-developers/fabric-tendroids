Detailed documentation of Fabric Tendroids components.

== Controllers

=== TendroidAnimationController

Manages tendroid animation and physics updates.

[source,python]
----
class TendroidAnimationController:
    def update(self, dt: float) -> None
    def check_creature_proximity(self, creature_pos: Vec3) -> bool
    def apply_avoidance(self, direction: Vec3) -> None
----

=== CreatureController

Handles creature behavior and movement.

=== InteractionController

Coordinates interactions between creatures and tendroids.

== Helpers

Helper modules contain frequently-changed logic separated from controllers.

=== interaction_helper

Physics calculations and collision detection.

=== animation_helper

Animation curves and timing functions.

== GPU Managers

=== WarpGPUManager

Manages NVIDIA Warp kernels for GPU-accelerated physics.

== Adapters

=== BubblePhysicsAdapter

Adapts bubble physics calculations to the tendroid system.

== Configuration

See xref:configuration.adoc[Configuration] for runtime settings.
