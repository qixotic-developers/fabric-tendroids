*Comprehensive technical documentation for the Tendroids animated creature system in NVIDIA Omniverse*

<<<

[abstract]
== Abstract

Tendroids is an advanced 3D animation system featuring interactive underwater tentacle-like creatures in NVIDIA Omniverse. Built with GPU-accelerated vertex deformation using NVIDIA Warp, the system creates smooth, organic breathing animations while maintaining real-time performance with 15+ simultaneous creatures. This manual provides complete documentation covering architecture, implementation, configuration, and optimization strategies.

=== Getting Help

When encountering issues:

1. Review relevant sections of this manual
2. Check code comments and docstrings
3. Profile performance before optimizing
4. Test with single Tendroid before scaling
5. Verify material safety status

[appendix]
== Glossary

[glossary]
Amplitude::
  Maximum radial expansion during breathing wave (0.0-1.0 scale)

Breathing Wave::
  Single traveling bulge that creates breathing animation effect

Bulge Length::
  Size of breathing wave as percentage of total Tendroid length

Fabric API::
  High-performance USD access layer in Omniverse (USDRT)

Flare Ratio::
  Ratio of bell base radius to cylinder radius (typically 2.0-3.0)

Glass Material::
  Transparent/refractive material that causes GPU crashes with dynamic geometry

Material Safety::
  System that detects and blocks problematic materials to prevent crashes

Profile Curve::
  2D shape swept along path to create 3D surface

Swept Torus::
  Surface created by sweeping circle profile along circular path

Tendroid::
  Individual animated cylindrical creature with flared base

USDRT::
  High-performance USD runtime API (Real-Time)

Warp::
  NVIDIA framework for GPU-accelerated Python computation

Wave Speed::
  Vertical travel speed of breathing wave (units per second)
