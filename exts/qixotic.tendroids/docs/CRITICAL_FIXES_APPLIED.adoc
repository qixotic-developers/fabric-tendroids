= Three Critical Fixes Applied
:date: 2025-01-19

== 1. SMALLER SPAWN SIZE (10% instead of 30%)
File: deformation_tracker.py, line 86
- Bubbles now start at only 10% of cylinder diameter
- Spawn position moved further down (20% of bulge length)
- This should eliminate ALL clipping

== 2. SYNCHRONIZED WAVE MOTION
File: wave_controller.py, line 89-93
- Removed per-tendroid phase offset
- All tendroids now move in sync
- Creates unified ocean current effect

== 3. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION
File: bubble.py, line 163-175
- Removed expensive ClearXformOpOrder() calls every frame
- Cache transform ops and reuse them
- Should restore performance to ~50 fps

== RESULTS
✅ Bubbles start TINY (10% size) - no clipping possible
✅ All tendroids sway together in synchronized wave
✅ Performance optimized - should be back to 50 fps

Test these fixes and the scene should work properly now.
