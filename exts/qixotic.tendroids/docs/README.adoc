= Tendroids Extension
:toc:
:toclevels: 2

== Overview

Tendroids is an Omniverse extension for creating and animating interactive cylinder-based wormlike sea creatures. It uses Fabric/USDRT for optimal performance and supports real-time interaction.

== Features

* *Procedural Geometry*: Dynamically generated cylinder meshes with flared bases
* *Transform-Based Animation*: Breathing wave effect using segment scaling
* *Idle Motion*: Subtle swaying for organic appearance
* *Performance Optimized*: Targets 60fps with 15 creatures
* *Simple UI*: Easy-to-use control panel for spawning and managing Tendroids

== Installation

=== Requirements

* NVIDIA Omniverse (Composer or Create)
* Python 3.10+
* Fabric/USDRT 7.6.1+

=== Setup

1. Copy the extension folder to your Omniverse extensions directory:
+
----
<omniverse-app>/exts/qixotic.tendroids/
----

2. Enable the extension in Omniverse:
+
* Open Extension Manager (Window → Extensions)
* Search for "Tendroids"
* Enable the extension

== Quick Start

=== Basic Usage

1. *Open Tendroid Controls window* (Window → Tendroid Controls)
2. *Configure spawn settings*:
   - Count: Number of Tendroids (1-50)
   - Area Width/Depth: Spawn region size
   - Segments: Animation resolution (8-32)
3. *Click "Spawn Tendroids"* to create creatures
4. *Click "Start Animation"* to begin breathing animation
5. *Click "Stop Animation"* to pause
6. *Click "Clear All"* to remove all Tendroids

=== Performance Tips

* Start with 5-10 Tendroids to test performance
* Reduce segment count (12-16) for better performance
* Smaller spawn areas reduce viewport overhead

=== Animation System

==== Breathing Animation

* Traveling sine wave moves up Tendroid length
* Gaussian envelope creates smooth wave focus
* Positive-only wave (expansion, not contraction)
* Configurable speed, wavelength, amplitude
* Delay between cycles

==== Idle Motion

* Subtle side-to-side sway
* Gentle rotation oscillation
* Different frequencies for organic appearance
* Can be enabled/disabled per Tendroid

== Troubleshooting

=== Common Issues

==== Extension Won't Load

* Check Omniverse version compatibility
* Verify extension.toml is correct
* Check console for Python errors

==== Poor Performance

* Reduce Tendroid count
* Decrease segment count
* Disable idle motion
* Close other extensions

==== Animation Not Updating

* Ensure "Start Animation" was clicked
* Check console for errors
* Verify stage is valid

== Development

=== Phase 1 Status (Current)

* ✅ Transform-based segment animation
* ✅ Procedural cylinder generation
* ✅ Breathing wave animation
* ✅ Idle motion system
* ✅ Multi-Tendroid management
* ✅ Basic UI controls

=== Phase 2 Planned

* Vertex-level deformation (if needed)
* Bubble generation and physics
* Environmental flora
* Real-time user interaction
* Material effects
* Performance optimization
