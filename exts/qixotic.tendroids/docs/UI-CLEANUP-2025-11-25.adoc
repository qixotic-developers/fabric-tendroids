= UI Cleanup Summary
:date: 2025-11-25

== Changes Made

=== Simplified Control Panel

**Window renamed:** "Tendroid Controls" → "Tendroid Manager"

**Sections removed:**
- Tendroid Geometry (removed entirely)
- Status Display (removed entirely)

**Sections kept:**
- Spawn Settings (simplified to Count only)
- Wave Motion (all parameters)
- Bubble Settings (all parameters)
- Actions (Spawn, Clear, Start, Stop)

=== Visual Improvements

**Dark backgrounds added** to match Property window style:
- Background color: `0xFF23211F` (dark gray)
- Applied to: Spawn Settings, Wave Motion, Bubble Settings
- Added 4px padding spacers at top/bottom of each section

=== Spawn Settings Simplified

**Before:** Count, Area Width, Area Depth, Radius Min, Radius Max
**After:** Count only

**Hardcoded defaults** in action_buttons.py:
- Spawn area: 400×400
- Radius range: 8.0-12.0
- Radial segments: 24
- Height segments: 48

=== Window Docking

**Docking preference:** `ui.DockPreference.RIGHT_BOTTOM`
- Should dock near Property window by default
- User can still manually position/dock as needed

== Console Customization

**Not implemented** - Kit SDK console is a core component with fixed formatting that cannot be easily customized from extensions.

**Alternative:** Could create a custom log window with:
- Filtered messages (only Tendroid-related)
- Custom formatting
- Larger fonts
- No timestamps

Would you like me to create this custom log window instead?
