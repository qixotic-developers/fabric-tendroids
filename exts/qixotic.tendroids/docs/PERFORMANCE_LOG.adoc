= Tendroids Performance Log
:toc:
:toclevels: 2

== Overview

This document tracks performance benchmarks as features are added to the Tendroids system.
All tests use Warp GPU acceleration on RTX 4090 unless otherwise noted.

== Test Environment

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Component | Specification

| GPU | NVIDIA RTX 4090
| Monitor | 60Hz (default), 240Hz (planned)
| Omniverse | USD Composer with Fabric & USDRT 7.6.1
| Mesh Config | 24 radial segments, 48 height segments per tendroid
|===

== Baseline Benchmarks

=== V2 System (2025-01-XX)

Initial V2 stress test results:

| Tendroids | Bubbles | FPS | Notes

| 15 | 15 | 60 | Target production config
| 30 | 30 | 40 | Performance ceiling test

| Method | ms/frame | Theoretical FPS

| Warp GPU | 0.68 | 1,480
| NumPy | 2.55 | 392
| Pure Python | 6.67 | 150

== Planned Tests

=== 240Hz Monitor Testing

Will test with 240Hz monitor to determine:

* Maximum achievable FPS with current config
* Whether GPU headroom allows more tendroids at high refresh
* V-sync impact on performance scaling

=== Feature Impact Tests

Track FPS impact as features are added:

* [ ] Wave motion system
* [ ] Caustic lighting
* [ ] Environmental props (kelp, debris)
* [ ] Swept torus topology

== Performance Guidelines

=== Target FPS by Use Case

[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
| Use Case | Target FPS | Max Tendroids

| Demo/Presentation | 60 | 15
| Interactive | 30 | 30
| Stress Test | Any | 45+
|===

=== Optimization Notes

* Bubble visuals use simplified spheres (no deformation)
* Hide-until-clear eliminates clipping with zero cost
* Wave motion uses pre-computed phase offsets
